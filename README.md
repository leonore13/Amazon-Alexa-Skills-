# Amazon-Alexa-Skills-
Some skills I wrote for Amazon's voice-activated companion program, Alexa. 

If you have an Amazon account, you can try them out here: https://echosim.io/welcome?next=%2F 

#### Incorrect Facts: [LIVE! https://skills-store.amazon.com/deeplink/dp/B01HZ04H24?deviceType=app&share&refSuffix=ss_copy]

Alexa is full of uninformative facts. Just ask her! "Incorrect Fact" is a silly app that parodies Alexa's fact generating skill. Simply ask Alexa for a (incorrect) fact, and let her help you impress at your next cocktail party!

Try: "Alexa, ask Incorrect Facts for a fact."

#### Job Finder: [IN DEVELOPMENT]

Let Alexa help you find a job! This skill scours through various job databases to help you find postings to the position of your dreams.

Try: "Alexa, ask Job Finder for a software development job."
