Some skills I wrote for Amazon's voice-activated companion device, Alexa. 

If you have an Amazon Developer account, you can try them out here: https://echosim.io/welcome?next=%2F 

#### Incorrect Facts: [CERTIFICATION PENDING]

Alexa is full of uninformative facts. Just ask her! "Incorrect Fact" is a silly app that parodies Alexa's fact generating skill. Simply ask Alexa for a (incorrect) fact, and let her help you impress at your next cocktail party!

Try: "Alexa, ask Incorrect Fact for a fact."
